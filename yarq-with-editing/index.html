				<p class="update"><strong>UPDATE 01.05.2012:</strong> No idea if this still works, it probably doesn't.</p>
				
				<p>On my old site I used to have a random quote feature. When I moved to WordPress I missed it so I found a plugin that displayed random quotes. It was called Yet Another Random Quote (yarq for short) and lives at <a href="http://openmonday.org/2006/07/31/yet-another-random-quote/">http://openmonday.org/2006/07/31/yet-another-random-quote/</a>. It's a good plugin and works well, but it could only add and delete quotes, not edit existing ones. So I changed it a bit, added editing functionality and moved the quote text fields above the quote list, which I thought was better when you had a lot of quotes. After I'd changed it I emailed the author twice to ask him if he wanted to use my changes in his next version but never heard back from him. So IÂ´m gonna distribute my version here:</p>

				<p><a href="yarq.php.txt">Download</a></p>

				<p>You can use Options-&gt;YARQ to change the display format, and Manage-&gt;Quotes to add, edit and delete the quotes. If my changes ever make it to the trunk I'll stop distributing it here and just link to the main version. If <a href="http://openmonday.org">Frank van der Brink</a> ever reads this, get in contact with me at einar [at] einaregilsson.com and I'll send you the patch for my changes.</p>
