				<p>Welcome to einaregilsson.com. I'm setting up this site mostly to keep track of my various small programming projects. I have a few Mozilla extensions, some Greasemonkey scripts, WordPress plugins and one or two .NET projects scattered around the web, so I thought it would be good to gather them all in one place. Many of them are still hosted elsewhere but there will at least be a link to all of them here. I haven't finished putting everything on the projects page yet but it'll be there soon.</p>

				<p>I might also write the occasional blog post, however I have my personal blog (in icelandic) over at <a href="http://einaregilsson.com/oldblog/">einaregilsson.com/oldblog/</a> so this place will only be for tech related stuff. I have a few technical things I've been wanting to write about but wouldn't be of interest to the readers of my personal blog so IÂ´ll post them here when I have the time.</p>
