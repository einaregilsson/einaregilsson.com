				<h4>The problem</h4>
				<p>
					In mid 2014 I moved back to Iceland after spending 7 years in Denmark. I still have same bank accounts in Denmark and sometimes still have to transfer money and do other things in my danish netbank. For many operations the netbanks sends an SMS message to your phone to confirm the operation, but I don't have a danish number anymore, and you can't put in an icelandic phone number. The alternative to getting an SMS is calling the bank after making a large transfer or other operation, and talking to a person that asks you a few questions to confirm who you are. This irritated me, especially since I don't like the following things:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Speaking danish to people on the phone</li>
					<li>Speaking on the phone</li>
					<li>Speaking to people</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					I thought about getting a danish sim card, but the pre-paid ones don't work outside Denmark, and I didn't really want a subscription for the occasional sms, I really just wanted to get the SMS from the bank to my icelandic phone.
