				<p>Redirector is a browser add-on for Firefox, Chrome, Edge and Opera. The add-on lets you create redirects for specific webpages, e.g. always redirect http://bing.com to http://google.com. It was originally done by <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=549272" title="Link to original request thread">request</a> for someone on the Mozillazine forums. The redirect patterns can be specified using regular expressions or simple wildcards and the resulting url can use substitutions based on captures from the original url. The add-on can for example be used to redirect a site to its https version, redirect news paper articles to their print versions, redirect pages to use specific proxy servers and more.</p>

				<p>From its initial version in 2007 and up until 2015 it was a Firefox-only add-on. In 2015 I rewrote it from scratch and now the same source is used to build the add-on for four browsers. I wrote <a href="/writing-a-browser-extension-for-three-browsers/">a blog post describing that rewrite</a> and what was required to make it work on all the browsers. Below are links to the add-on page for each browser where you can install the add-on: </p>
